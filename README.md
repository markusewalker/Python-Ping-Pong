# Python Ping Pong

### Description
The classic game of Ping Pong written in the Python programming language. This project was inspired and referenced by https://github.com/srimani-programmer/Ping-Pong-Game. This adds onto to the referenced project by fixing miscellanous bugs and adding the following features:

- Customizable player names
- Customizable background (by default, it is Sonic the Hedgehog)
- Customizable final score so that there is a clear winner that achieves ultimate Ping Pong bragging rights

### How To Play
Player 1 - Use the `w` and `s` keys to move up and down, respectively.
Player 2 - Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move up and down, respectively.

### Prerequisites
Although this project is cross-platform, you will need to ensure your environment has the following:

- Python 3
- Python library `turtle`

While `turtle` should be a pre-installed Python library, you will need to ensure your installation of Python 3 comes with the library.

### Running via Command-line
1. Clone this repository to a local environment.
2. Open your command-line and navigate to the downloaded folder (if needed, unzip first).
3. Depending upon how your environment handles Python 3, you may do one of two things:
     - `python python-ping-pong.py`
     - `python3 python-ping-pong.py`

If you are on a GUI such as IDLE, run the module as any other Python file and that should work as well.

Here is a preview of the game once it is successfully launched:
